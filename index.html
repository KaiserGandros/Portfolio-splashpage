            <p>
            Born in Calais, Maine and moving to michigan as a boy, Joshua has experienced a life full of adventure and travel ever since his younger ages.
            since the age of 8, he would take frequent trips out west during the summer to see and to stay with his big sister in places like Denver, CO and Wilston, ND 
            eventually till he decided to complete his highschool career in Eugene, OR. Excluding the summer, Josh mostly grew up in battle creek and hasting areas and was known to be quite savvy on everything computer related. From playing videogames to building his and others PCs, Josh was usually found in his computer room.
            Currently, Joshua plans to continue his hermit like life style by continuing his adventures in to the coding world! Joshua is currently enrolled into a MSU backed fullstack bootcamp and has already scraped some skin in a few projects.
